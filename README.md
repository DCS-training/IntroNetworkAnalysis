## IntroNetworkAnalysis

This is a repository for the [**Introduction to Network Analysis**](https://www.cdcs.ed.ac.uk/events/intro-to-network-analysis-gephi) course provided by [**Brian Wong**](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/tsz-ho-wong) for the CDCS. Within the repository there are files with sample datasets and a guide to building datasets. It will be updated before each section.

## IMPORTANT: Things to Do Before the First Class 

Before your first session, please download [Gephi 0.10.1](https://gephi.org/users/download/) to your own device. You can choose to download the Windows or Mac version. It is **mandatory that you install Gephi before coming to class**. This is because it takes some time to download and, due to the tight schedule, **we would not be able to wait for everyone in the class to do so**.     

After installing Gephi, please also install the **Gephi plugins**. Go to the Tools menu and install **GeoLayout** and **ExportToEarth**:

- Tools > Plugins > Available Plugins > GeoLayout
- Tools > Plugins > Available Plugins > ExportToEarth

If you have any problems downloading Gephi, please contact Brian at twong4@ed.ac.uk.

Please also bring a **computer mouse**, as you will not be able to navigate Gephi without it.
